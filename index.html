            <h2>Barbie (2023) Review </h2>
            <p class="author">June 24, 2023 by Nicholas Smith</p>
            <p>Since the announcement of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken, Barbie (2023) immediately
               became one of my most anticipated movies.
               My excitement continuously grew to the point where I was slightly worried that I'd hyped up a film that
               could never meet my ridiculously high expectations. Today I've learnt to never doubt Greta Gerwig even in
               the slightest bit. She's a truly remarkable film maker. Barbie was everything I could've asked for.
            </p>
            <p>I think I underestimated just how funny Barbie was actually gonna be. This movie was absolutely
               hilarious, my theatre broke out in laughter all throughout this. The cast really delivered. For the most
               part everyone got their moment to get a line in that really stuck the landing. Even the unexpected pop
               culture references don't feel forced or out of place. This charismatic cast really elevated this
               screenplay to hilarious heights.</p>

            <p>Margot Robbie continues to prove she's one of the biggest stars of this generation of actors. A
               nomination is absolutely certain for her. She was the perfect person to bring this Barbie story to life.
               I fell more in love with her as an actress and I didn't even think that was possible because of how much
               I already do. She and Gosling were a great pair to build this movie around. Absolutely loved her scenes
               with America as well who really felt like the heart of the movie.

               The technical aspects were very impressive. The movie looks absolutely amazing and really has the doll
               like feel.</p>

            <p>This was a hilarious but also very emotional watch. Navigating this world is tricky, it's uncomfortable ,
               painful but also very beautiful. It's difficult for me to put into words but there's just something about
               the way Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig convey the human experience that just hits me. Through the
               hardships, boredom, confusion and moments where you're not even quite sure who you are there's still a
               lot of beauty that comes with being alive and their movies remind of that. When Billie Eillish's 'What
               was I made for' plays during the emotional climax of the film, I was an absolute wreck. I can't wait to
               watch this again. Greta Gerwig is 3/3!!!</p>

            <h2>Oppenheimer (2023) Review</h2>
            <p class="author">July 29, 2023 by Nicholas Smith</p>
            <p>The movie is very well made it just didn't personally resonate with me as much as I would've liked
               because I'm not
               really familiar with the subject material. The cinematography is stunning and I absolutely love the score
               but I left
               this without any strong feelings toward the actual story. I can totally see Oppenheimer being a top
               contender for the
               technical categories rightfully so but I think I'll need to rewatch it at some point to truly get it.</p>
